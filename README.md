# Weather py
Randomly select cities using latitude and longitude and near city and print the result to make sure it meets at least 500 cities count. 
1. clean data to get rid of humidity that's 100 to plot 4 scatter plot to show relationship between latitude and Max temp, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity world wide. 
2. Second part is the creat subset of cities based in Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere to later plot and linear regression. 

Conclusion: 
In northern Hemisphere it's very clear that latitude corelates to max temperature. Max temperature goes higher when it's closer to equation line. South Hemispher shows similar trend. Other vairance like humidity, wind speed and cloudiness do not show strong corelation with latitude. 

# Vacantion Py
1. calling googlemap API to plot the heatmap of humidiy. 
2. Narrow down the cities using filtering dataframe to get the ideal weather city list
3. using Google place API to find the nearest hotel within 5000km.
4. plot the hotel on map with hotel details.
